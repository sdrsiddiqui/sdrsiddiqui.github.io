Every day, we are [create]( (https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=WRL12345USEN)) 2.5 quintillions(10<sup>18</sup>) bytes of data, out of which 90 percent of the data in the world has been created in the last two years alone. This massive amount of data is generated every now and then by millions of devices around us and with various social networking websites.

Data can be transformed into meaningful insights to help organizations in taking crucial decisions in their business by extracting valuable data-driven insights from the tremendous amount of data present in the world. It helps them creating value-added data products.

The person who generates valuable insights and patterns from the data is called Data Scientist. No wonder why it is an important asset for the company as regarded as one of the important jobs of the century.

The term data science became very difficult to explain especially in today world. "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining." ---<cite>[Wikipedia]( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)</cite>.

>In other words, it is a set of fundamental principles that guide the extraction of knowledge of data.

A very good explanation of the word data science is explained by [Drew Conway’s Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) on his blog.

*Drew Conway’s Data Science Venn Diagram*

Based on this diagram, which captures the spirit of the word “data science”, it comprises of three different kinds of knowledge:

**1.Statistics:** For modeling and summarizing datasets (which are increasing day by day).

**2.Computer knowledge:** For gathering, processing and visualizing the data (designing and using the algorithms).

**3.The domain expertise:** For expressing the correct questions and to put their answers in context.

As it can be seen that, these are not a new domain of knowledge to learn but a new set of skills are required which are easy to learn.

### Why Python is used for Data Science ###

**Easy to learn:**  Learning curve of Python is fast because it is easy to learn. The syntax are similar to the other programming languages which makes the code easy to read and understand by others.

**Open source:** Python is free and open source, which means Python source code is available for the public and anyone can contribute to its continuous development.

**Active community:** Python has a  has a large and active scientific community which is there to help when ran across a problem or issue.

**Scalable:**  It is fast and scalable as compared to other languages like R, Stata, Matlab.

**Packages:** Various open source third-party packages are available for data science.
* NumPy for manipulation of homogeneous array based data
* Pandas for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data
* SciPy for common scientific computing tasks
* Matplotlib for publication-quality visualizations
* IPython for interactive execution and sharing of code
* Scikit-Learn for machine learning

It allows the programmer to focus on the task at hand fastly.

### Data science Project cycle ###

1. Extract : Need data first before we do anything on it. Data may have to be acquire from one or multiple sources
2. Organize : Next step is to organize or process the data.
3. Analyse + model : Next step is to analyze and create model
4. Present : Present it which could be in different formats like report etc.


### Environment for data science ###

For new users, it is recommended to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), The Most Popular Python Data Science Platform. Anaconda installs Python, Jupyter Notebook and other packages used for data science.
