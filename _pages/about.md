Hello, and welcome to my learning and sharing experience!

I have a Master in System Information Architecture and worked a few years as a consultant in Paris. Now, I have decided to dedicate myself totally to data, as it is the new oil. I am interested in data science and machine learning.
This blog is going to be a personal online journal for the topics of data science and machine learning, which I hope, will help other inspiring data lovers. The source code of all the projects could be found on the GitHub profile.

This place is dedicated to all the people who are passionate about data science and machine learning who wants and love to predict trends, gain insight and analyze data.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, ideas, concerns for me.

Thank you for stopping by and stay tuned for more.
