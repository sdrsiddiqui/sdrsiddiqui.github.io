Hello, and welcome to my learning and sharing experience!

I completed a Master in System Information Architecture and worked a few years as a computer engineer in Paris.

This blog is a personal online journal for my future self. I gather information from various sources about the topics on which I am working or will need it in future projects. The idea is to collect related information at once place so I donâ€™t waste time to search the same information again. I hope this can help others also.

Today, I work as a data engineer and interested in data science and machine learning. The source code of all the projects could be found on the GitHub profile. This place is dedicated to all the people who are passionate about data science and machine learning who wants and love to predict trends, gain insight, and analyze data.

Any opinions expressed on this blog are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my past or current employers.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, ideas, concerns for me.
Thank you for stopping by and stay tuned for more.
