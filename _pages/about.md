Hello, and welcome to my learning and sharing experience!

I wanted to start a blog for many years. Better late than never. So finally I started this blog as a personal online journal for technical and programming-related posts. I am moving towards the domain of data science and machine learning, so most of the post will be about them. I will be documenting things which I will find interesting for my future self.

These days I am doing some projects on data science which could be found on my Github profile.
