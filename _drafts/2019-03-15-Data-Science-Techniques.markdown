This post is about EDA phase. EDA means Exploratory data analysis. We will learn important EDA techniques which is used by every data Scientist.

Basic structure
Summary structure
Distributions
Grouping
Crosstabs
Pivots

Numpy:
It is a fundamental tools for scientific computing as it has very efficient array operations  and provided high level mathematical functions.
It is very good for homogeneous data types but in real world data set we have heterogenous datasets( numerical as well categorical features).


To tackle this heterogeneous datasets, we use pandas. Pandas is built on top of Numpy which allows operations on tabular data.

Rows is an observations
column is a features or attributes

If we have columns of different data types, pandas help us to deal with such data types in an efficient manner.
The tabular data structure consists of rows and columns and in terms of pandas we call it a data frame. On data frame we can use lots of functions and joints.
Matplotlib is used by pandas for creating visualizations.






Functions act as stand alone segments of code that usually take an input, perform some processing, and return some output. When we're working with Python lists, we can use the len() function to calculate the length of a list, but if we're working with Python strings, we can also use len()

In contrast, methods are special functions that belong to a specific type of object. Python lists have a list.append() method that we can use to add an item to the end of a list.
