<p>Every day, we are <a href="(https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=WRL12345USEN)">create</a> 2.5 quintillions(10<sup>18</sup>) bytes of data, out of which 90 percent of the data in the world has been created in the last two years alone. This massive amount of data is generated every now and then by millions of devices around us and with various social networking websites.</p>

<p>Data can be transformed into meaningful insights to help organizations in taking crucial decisions in their business by extracting valuable data-driven insights from the tremendous amount of data present in the world. It helps them creating value-added data products.</p>

<p>The person who generates valuable insights and patterns from the data is called Data Scientist. No wonder why it is an important asset for the company as regarded as one of the important jobs of the century.</p>

<p>The term data science became very difficult to explain especially in today world. “Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.” —<cite><a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Wikipedia</a></cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, it is a set of fundamental principles that guide the extraction of knowledge of data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very good explanation of the word data science is explained by <a href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram">Drew Conway’s Data Science Venn Diagram</a> on his blog.</p>

<p><em>Drew Conway’s Data Science Venn Diagram</em></p>

<p>Based on this diagram, which captures the spirit of the word “data science”, it comprises of three different kinds of knowledge:</p>

<p>Functions act as stand alone segments of code that usually take an input, perform some processing, and return some output. When we’re working with Python lists, we can use the len() function to calculate the length of a list, but if we’re working with Python strings, we can also use len()</p>

<p>In contrast, methods are special functions that belong to a specific type of object. Python lists have a list.append() method that we can use to add an item to the end of a list. 
<strong>1.Statistics:</strong> For modeling and summarizing datasets (which are increasing day by day).</p>

<p><strong>2.Computer knowledge:</strong> For gathering, processing and visualizing the data (designing and using the algorithms).</p>

<p><strong>3.The domain expertise:</strong> For expressing the correct questions and to put their answers in context.</p>

<h3 id="why-python-is-used-for-data-science">Why Python is used for Data Science</h3>

<p>When we execute Python code, the Python interpreter converts your code into bytecode that your computer can understand, and then runs that bytecode.
Python is what we call a high-level language. High level languages allow you to write programs faster as the interpreter makes the decisions on how to execute your instructions</p>

<p><strong>Easy to learn:</strong>   Python is a simple scripting language that makes it easy to interact with data that makes it learning curve easy.</p>

<p><strong>Open source:</strong> Python is free and open source, which means Python source code is available for the public and anyone can contribute to its development.</p>

<p><strong>Active community:</strong> Python has a large and active scientific community so it is easy to get help.</p>

<p><strong>Scalable:</strong>  It is fast and scalable as compared to other languages like R, Stata, Matlab.</p>

<p><strong>Packages:</strong> Wide range of packages that make it easy to get started and build application. Some of them are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NumPy for manipulation of homogeneous array based data</li>
  <li>Pandas for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data</li>
  <li>SciPy for common scientific computing tasks</li>
  <li>Matplotlib for publication-quality visualizations</li>
  <li>IPython for interactive execution and sharing of code</li>
  <li>Scikit-Learn for machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>It allows the programmer to focus on the task at hand fastly.</p>

<h3 id="data-science-project-cycle">Data science Project cycle</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Extract : Need data first before we do anything on it. Data may have to be acquire from one or multiple sources</li>
  <li>Organize : Next step is to organize or process the data.</li>
  <li>Analyse + model : Next step is to analyze and create model</li>
  <li>Present : Present it which could be in different formats like report etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="environment-for-data-science">Environment for data science</h3>

<p>For new users, it is recommended to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>, The Most Popular Python Data Science Platform. Anaconda installs Python, Jupyter Notebook and other packages used for data science.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2018-12-15-Data-Science/2_Anaconda.png" alt="Anaconda" /></p>

<p><em>Download Anaconda for Python 3</em></p>

<p>ipython notebook is more like</p>

<p>Welcome to iPython notebook which is very useful tool for machine learning and data science algorithms.
It blends two things, Python(a simple scripting programming language) and Wiki pages. So, Python plus Wiki pages is the iPython notebook.</p>

<p>IPython is about using Python effectively for interactive scientific and data-intensive
computing.</p>

<p>Launching the IPython Shell</p>

<p>Start by launching the IPython inter‐preter by typing ipython on the command line</p>
